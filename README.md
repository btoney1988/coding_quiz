## Coding Quiz
 - This is a coding quiz. This is a timed quiz that subtracts for wrong answers and adds for correct answers. Each correct answer is 10 points and wrong answer is -3 points. There is a heads up display while playing the game to inform user of the time, how many quiestions are left, and how the user is doing.  
 - There are 3 pages that are all connected using javascript. For the quiz.js and endscreen.js I tried to use mostly javascript and for the home.js I used jQuery.
 - I received some help from youTube channel James Q Quick "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-T8W79DN6PBnzomelvqJYw" and W3 schools helped out with the quiz questions "https://www.w3schools.com/"
